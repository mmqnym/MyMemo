# MyMemo

This is the first time I have programmed a GUI program, the main function is a desktop calendar. It can add, delete, list matters, and set alarms/detailed information for the things. It provides the most basic functions. To avoid data loss, the user data will be backed up periodically. To reach the purpose of real-time reminder, the program will be written in the Windows registry during the program execution, so that `MyMemo` can start up automatically in the background when booting.
